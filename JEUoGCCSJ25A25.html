                <h1>University of Guelph - CCS <br>Part Time January 2025 to April 2024</h1>
                <h2>
                    Job Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For my Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 co-op work terms, I was employed at the University of Guelph as a student consultant in CCS (Computing and Communications Services) as part of the Client Productivity team. The Computing and Communications Services department at the institute is one of the largest IT departments on campus. It provides central information technology (IT) support and services to most of the university's academic and service departments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the services that CCS provides are remote campus community, including internet connectivity in residence and on-campus, Gryph mail, calendaring and Office 365 applications, software distribution website, central login accounts, and many other services. The department also provides IT support to the university's student body. The Client Productivity team is one of the specialized sub-departments that make up CCS as a whole and mainly works directly with the clients that CCS serves to solve fundamental IT issues or redirect clients to departments/sub-departments that are able to resolve their problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big part of the Client Productivity sub-department is the Help Centre & IT Desk support areas, which provide first-level support to clients through phone and email support and face-to-face support at the IT Help Desk in the McLaughlin Library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Reflection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the conclusion of my Summer 2024 co-op term with CCS at the University of Guelph, I was given the opportunity to continue working part-time in the same role as a student consultant. This transition from full-time co-op to part-time employment allowed me to maintain my involvement with the Client Productivity team while resuming my academic responsibilities. Remaining in this role provided valuable continuity, enabling me to further refine the skills I had developed over the summer and apply them in new, evolving situations within the department.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continuing part-time has also allowed me to take on more responsibility and operate with increased independence. Iâ€™ve become more confident in troubleshooting issues, assisting clients efficiently, and providing mentorship to newer staff. Balancing this work alongside my studies has helped me improve my time management, reinforced my commitment to professional development, and solidified my understanding of IT support within a real-world context.
