                <h1>Introduction - About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my professional portfolio. My name is Nolan Van, and I am a Bachelor of Computing Honours student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Guelph. As a member of the School of Computer Science and an active participant in the co-operative education (co-op) program, I am building a strong foundation in software development, systems design, and data-driven problem solving. My academic foundation is strengthened by a strong personal drive for growth, enabling me to apply theoretical concepts in practical settings while continuously advancing my technical and professional skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is a curated overview of my academic achievements, co-op placements, and personal and collaborative projects. It highlights the practical applications of my studies, ranging from software development/engineering in various coding languages, algorithmic analysis, operating systems, networks, cryptography, cyber analysis, and teamwork in professional and academic environments. Each section on this portfolio reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to adapt and grow within dynamic and multidisciplinary settings. I aim to contribute meaningfully to organizations that value innovation, efficiency, and thoughtful design, while also continuing to advance my own technical and professional skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're an employer looking for a dedicated and capable candidate, a researcher exploring potential collaborators, or a professional in the tech community, I invite you to explore my portfolio. It reflects not only the skills I bring to the table, but also the curiosity, work ethic, and enthusiasm I bring to every challenge. I look forward to opportunities where I can continue to grow, contribute, and make an impact in the field of computing.
                </p>

                    This website is a living portfolio and is constantly being updated with new content as I progress through my academic and professional journey. Whether it's a recent co-op experience, a new project, a technical blog post, or updated reflections on my learning, I aim to keep this space current and relevant. I believe in documenting growth as it happensâ€”showcasing not just the final outcomes, but the process and progress behind them.
