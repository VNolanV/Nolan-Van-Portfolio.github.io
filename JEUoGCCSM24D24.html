                    Job Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For my Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 co-op work terms, I was employed at the University of Guelph as a student consultant in CCS (Computing and Communications Services) as part of the Client Productivity team. The Computing and Communications Services department at the institute is one of the largest IT departments on campus. It provides central information technology (IT) support and services to most of the university's academic and service departments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the services that CCS provides are remote campus community, including internet connectivity in residence and on-campus, Gryph mail, calendaring and Office 365 applications, software distribution website, central login accounts, and many other services. The department also provides IT support to the university's student body. The Client Productivity team is one of the specialized sub-departments that make up CCS as a whole and mainly works directly with the clients that CCS serves to solve fundamental IT issues or redirect clients to departments/sub-departments that are able to resolve their problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big part of the Client Productivity sub-department is the Help Centre & IT Desk support areas, which provide first-level support to clients through phone and email support and face-to-face support at the IT Help Desk in the McLaughlin Library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    4 Month Reflection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, the last 4 months (at the time of this writing) have been an enlightening experience that has given me the opportunity to grow and develop both on a professional and personal level. While the job itself may not seem as exciting as other jobs related to Computer Science, I believe that nature of the job itself gave me the opportunity to develop other soft skills that would be required in the industry; such as time and situation management, problem solving, client skills, and communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    8 Month Reflection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, the previous 8 months that I have spent at this co-op position has been an enlightening experience that has given me the opportunity to grow, develop and build upon all of the different areas and skills that I initially developed in the first 4 months of this placement. Overall, my opinin of my placement still remains the same; while the job itself may not seem as exciting as other jobs related to Computer Science, I believe that nature of the job itself gave me the opportunity to develop other soft skills that would be required in the industry; such as time and situation management, problem solving, client skills,  and communication. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While working in a front-line IT support capacity is a hard job, it has given me an interesting perspective and understanding of how Computer Science fits into the world and how important all of the roles in IT support are to allow for the systems that we rely on to function. This work term was highly informative and allowed me to grow in more ways than I originally thought I would.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Acknowledgements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to acknowledge my supervisor, Jill Hogg, for her aid to me throughout my time here at CCS. She has trained and aided me since my first day at CCS and has always been there to assist me with matters where I encounter difficulty by teaching me how to deal with the situation by myself. She was also the one who gave me insight of the function and operation of many of the systems that I interacted/worked with over the course of my work term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I would also like to acknowledge my coworkers, Anna Tran, Daana Honarmand, Kaima Ifezue, Ishnoor Kaur and Sarah Cappellaro for being fantastic coworkers and team members who have also been there to also assist me during my time here at CCS.
                </p>
